# What You Get From This control-repo

This repository exists as a talend cloud installer control-repo that is used with R10k.

The major points are:
 - An environment.conf that correctly implements:
   - A site directory for roles, profiles, and any custom modules for your organization
   - A config_version script
 - Provided config_version scripts to output the commit of code that your agent just applied
 - Basic example of roles/profiles code
 - Example hieradata directory with pre-created common.yaml and nodes directory
   - These match the default hierarchy that ships with PE
